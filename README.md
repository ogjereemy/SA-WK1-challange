## Description
Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator.
Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade: 

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  49 to 59, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40. 

To be able to generate the above grades, we should use if and else if statements and give conditions to the program. We will create the function studentGradeGenerator and in the function we add the if and else if statements. And we created an HTML file to be able to prompt the user to enter the grade and then output the result is displayed as per the grade.

Challenge 2: Speed Detector.
Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

Here we will also use the if and else if conditionals to be able to be able to return the demerit points for every speed in Km/h. We create a function called speedGenerator and passed inputSpeed as the parameter. so when the function is called and the speed value is added it will return the demerit points.



Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator.
Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary. 

This had me thinking alot. If this deductions are true then serekali inatumaliza lol! anyways, in this section of the project we had to calculate the net salary together with the NHIFDeductions and NSSFDeductions. The net salary and gross salary are included in one function.
